NEWS is broken down into 3 parts

- READ NEWS
- CREATE A POST
- EDIT/DELETE A POST

Logged in as an Admin:
Read News should have the same look for both Admin and User, except the top menu showing 'create a post', 'edit/delete a post', 'read news' that will only show to the Admin.

- In the READ NEWS page, the Game column should import the name of the game related to that game in particular and have a link to the game in the catalog. News should be posted in an New to Old order, so Descending.

- In the CREATE A POST page, the Admin should be able to choose a Platform Type, a Game (which based on the list will connect to the game_id from the Database), a Subject and the Content of the News. When the Admin clicks on Submit the NEWS creates an ID automatically in the server and that news has an ID of its own.

- In the EDIT/DELETE A POST page each News_ID should have a link to that News in particular so we can edit. When clicking on that News_ID, it should take the Admin to a page where that news is being edited. This page will be called 'newsediting.php' and it is currently UNDER CONSTRUCTION. We do not have a direct link to this page.
